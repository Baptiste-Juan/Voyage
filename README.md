# Voyages

The purpose of this lab exercise is  to practice creating a website using HTML, CSS, Git,
and GitHub, to collaboratively build a website in a team of 6.

> You're passionate about travel. Together with your group,
> you decide to develop a website that presents your team
> and all the countries/cities you have visited or dream of visiting


## Features

The main features of our `voyages` project (excerpt from the lab description).

### Homepage and Country Pages

Create a homepage named `index.html`. Each person in the group
will make a page for their chosen country,
named after the country (e.g., `spain.html`).

### Navigation Bar

All pages must be accessible via a navigation bar that has two dropdown menus:

- One submenu lets users access country pages by continent.
- The other submenu lets users access country pages by the person who created them.

### CSS Organization

- Make a shared stylesheet called `voyages.css` for common styles across the site.
- Each country page must have its own CSS file, named after the country (e.g., `spain.css`).
- All CSS files should be stored in a `css` subfolder within the project directory.

### Page Content and Structure

- Each page should have a unique structure and style.
- Include tables, lists, Flexbox layouts, and forms.
- Use HTML5 tags and CSS animations/transitions (but keep it professional and not excessive).

### Project Workflow

- Divide tasks fairly among team members.
- Create a wireframe/mockup before starting development.
- Use Git for version control, with frequent commits from all members and clear commit messages.


## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install or set up the project locally.

## Requirements

List (dev) prerequisites needed before installation:
- Git
- GitHub account
- IDE like VsCode (or a text editor as a fallback)
- Web browser support

## Usage

> Explain how to use the project which mainly consists in opening the live/demo URL in a Web browser.
> If we do not use dynamically generated pages with PHP, but only stick to HTML, CSS, and JS, we can use GitHub Pages to automatically deploy the website each time the `main` branch is pushed.

## Demo

You can give the Voyages website a whirl.  
It is live and published automatically on *GitHub Pages*:
